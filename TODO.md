# TODO

- options
- json output
- formatters
- rename db to dbWrapper

- Make it easy to disable rules (using hash sums?)
- Remember when seagull first saw an issue so that new ones can be shown at the top


## Rule types

- Mistake (clear mistakes like mixed types in a field)
- Warnings (less important stuff like __v properties)
- Guesses (can't be sure if intentional)
